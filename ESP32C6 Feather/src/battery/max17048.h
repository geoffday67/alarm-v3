// MAX17048 ModelGauge LiPo fuel gauge, fitted on the Feather ESP32-C6 itself.
// It's powered from the cell (BAT), so it keeps running, and keeps its
// register contents, through the ESP32's deep sleep and any ESP32 reset.
//
// Registers are 16 bits, MSB first, and must be accessed as a whole word in
// one transaction (datasheet: "8-bit writes cause no effect", "Both register
// bytes must be read in the same transaction for the register data to be
// valid").
//
// Each function takes the I2CBus lock for its own transaction(s), so don't
// call them while holding an I2CBus::Guard. Requires I2CBus::begin() and IO20
// high (bus pull-ups on VSENSOR).

// Makes sure the gauge can't enter sleep mode: clears CONFIG.SLEEP (which
// forces an exit if it's asleep) then MODE.EnSleep. Both are 0 from the
// gauge's power-on reset, so normally this changes nothing.
//
// Sleep needs EnSleep = 1 plus either CONFIG.SLEEP = 1 or SDA and SCL both
// held low for tSLEEP (1.75-2.5 s). The bus pull-ups are on the IO20-switched
// rail, so the lines sit low throughout the ESP32's deep sleep. In sleep the
// gauge "halts all operations" and can't follow the cell, so the SOC would
// be wrong on waking. Hibernate is used instead (see max17048ForceHibernate()).

// Keeps the gauge in hibernate permanently: HIBRT = 0xFFFF (datasheet HIBRT
// Register). Hibernate draws 3-5 uA against 23-40 uA active, and converts
// (VCELL and SOC update) once every 45 s instead of every 250 ms.
//
// By default (HIBRT = 0x8030) the gauge switches itself: it enters hibernate
// once |CRATE| has been under HibThr (0x80 x 0.208 %/hr = 26.6 %/hr) for more
// than 6 minutes, and leaves it at any ADC sample where |OCV - VCELL| exceeds
// ActThr (0x30 x 1.25 mV = 60 mV) - e.g. the cell's voltage sag under a Wi-Fi
// or audio load - then stays active for at least those 6 minutes.
//
// The datasheet recommends forced hibernate for loads under C/4 (500 mA on a
// 2000 mAh cell); here the peaks are Wi-Fi TX (up to ~350 mA) and charging
// (~196 mA).
bool max17048ForceHibernate();

// Sets VRESET.Dis, turning off the fast analog comparator that detects the
// cell being removed and reinserted, while in hibernate. Hibernate supply
// current is then 3 uA typ / 5 uA max rather than 4 uA typ (Electrical
// Characteristics; the register description says "approximately 0.5uA").
// Removal/reinsertion is still detected by the ADC, just more slowly: the IC
// resets 250 ms after VCELL rises back above VRESET rather than 1 ms. Only
// matters for a quick cell swap (the gauge re-estimates SOC from the new
// cell after the reset); removing the cell for longer powers the gauge down
// anyway, since it runs from the cell. Read-modify-write, so the VRESET
// threshold is unchanged.

// nearest percent and clamped to 100, as the ModelGauge estimate can read
// slightly over 100% (e.g. while charging). From the gauge's built-in
// generic LiPo model, not a custom model for this cell. Updated every 45 s
// in hibernate.

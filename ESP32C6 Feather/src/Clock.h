// Clock.cpp), which also clears any pending tick. Doesn't set the time - see

// tick from the new time. WiFi must already be connected. Called only by
// TimeSync, which owns the schedule and the WiFi connection. Blocks for up to
// about 5 s waiting for a reply (three requests 1 s apart, then 3 s), plus up
// to 1 s to align the RTC write to the second.
// Returns false if no valid reply arrived (RTC left unchanged).

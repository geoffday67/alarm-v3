// GDEY029T94-FL03 (SSD1680) e-paper panel showing the time.
//
// Not thread-safe: only one task may call showTime() at a time. On a cold
// boot setup() calls powerOnInit() and its own showTime() before
// Clock::init() starts the clock task; from then on only the clock task
// calls it.
namespace Display {

// Configures the panel's GPIOs and SPI. Call on every boot, including each
// deep-sleep wake, before powerOnInit() or any showTime(). Releases the pad
// holds set by prepareForSleep() without glitching the pins. Doesn't talk to
// the panel.
void init();

// Call once on a cold boot (power-on, reset, reflash), after init() and
// before any showTime(). Full panel init and a full refresh to a blank
// screen, which seeds both RAM planes so partial
// refreshes work from then on. Must also be repeated if the panel ever loses
// power. Blocks the caller (~4.3 s), polling BUSY with vTaskDelay().
void powerOnInit();

// Drives the panel's interface inputs to fixed levels and holds them through
// the chip's deep sleep (RES# and CS# high, SCK/SDI/D/C low). Otherwise those
// pins float once the HP domain powers down: a floating RES# can reset the
// SSD1680 out of its deep sleep, and floating CMOS inputs draw through-current.
// Call just before esp_deep_sleep_start(), with no update in progress.
// Returns 0: the display has no wake sources (the return value is the ext1
// wake mask, as for the other modules' prepareForSleep()).
uint64_t prepareForSleep();

// Converts utc to local time (using the TZ set in setup()) and renders it
// as a 12-hour time, "H:MM" or "HH:MM" (no seconds), large on the left
// with the colon and minutes in a fixed place, "AM"/"PM" to its right on its
// baseline, and a phone-style battery indicator at the top left showing
// batteryPercent (0-100; negative for unknown, drawn as an empty outline
// with no number).
// Then refreshes the panel and puts the panel into its own deep sleep. Holds
// a Sleep inhibit for the duration, so the chip can't go into deep sleep
// mid-update.
//
// Always drawn with a fast partial refresh (~0.6 s), which relies on the RAM
// contents left by powerOnInit() or the previous update; these survive the
// ESP32's deep sleep because the panel is left in its RAM-retaining deep
// sleep (see prepareForSleep()). Every EPD_FULL_REFRESH_EVERY-th call
// (Constants.h) first clears the panel to white with a full, flashing
// refresh (~4.3 s), to clear ghosting; the count is kept in RTC memory
// across deep sleep. Blocks the caller until the panel
// finishes, but polls BUSY with vTaskDelay(), so other tasks keep running.

// Turns the eInk front light on. The PIC turns it off itself after its own
// on-time, so this returns as soon as the command is sent.
void showFrontLight();

// Turns the eInk front light on with no time limit, cancelling the PIC's
// on-time if a showFrontLight() is still running. Stays on, including while
// this chip deep sleeps, until frontLightOff().

// Turns the eInk front light off, however it was turned on.
